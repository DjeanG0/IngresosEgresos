# Web application to manage income and expenses of companies

Web application for an administrator to manage the income and expenses of their company. The system allows for the visualization of the company's totals so that the manager can make decisions about the financial situation.

The process of registering expenses and sales can be tedious, so the system administrator may decide to delegate registration to accounting personnel. Therefore, the application should allow for the creation of new users who should have the ability to make new money movements. However, these users should not be able to modify sensitive company information or create new users in order to avoid corruption risks. Additionally, since accounting transactions are extremely sensitive, the system should allow for traceability of who registered each transaction, which is why the system should have an authentication system.
